Please note and do not ignore.

This version of programming a cluster of workstations is now strongly deprecated!

A new system that uses a dedicated clusterBuilder and associated DSL is now available.

This versionwas used in the paper called
Groovy Parallel Patterns: A Process Oriented Parallelization Library
by Kerridge and Urquhart

The cluaterBuilder version has no need of a serialize method and thus these methods have
been commented out in this text.

It is crucial that groovy_parallel_patterns.1.0.9 onwards is used to compile programs using
the library.
